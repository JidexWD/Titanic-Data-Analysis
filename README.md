## Project Overview 
 A ship building company wants to know how the passenger class on the titanic affetced the survival rate on the titanic. they want to use this analysis to build better cabins for their ships. he project aims to investigate whether passenger class and age impacted survival rates in the Titanic tragedy to improve future ship designs. The company suspects that higher-class passengers had better chances of survival and wants to ensure equal access to emergency equipment for all passengers in emergencies.

## Data Analysis
## Results


 The data analytics dashboard reveals significant differences in survival rates among various passenger classes on the Titanic. When examining the survival percentages, a substantial disparity is evident. First-class passengers had almost three times the survival rate compared to third-class passengers. This underscores the importance of analyzing survival percentages rather than merely the total number of survivors.

For first-class passengers, the survival rate is approximately 60%. However, when considering the percentage of survivors within each class, the rate is notably higher, emphasizing the critical need to differentiate between overall survival rates and class-specific survival percentages.

Age also played a significant role in survival outcomes. Second-class children had a 100% survival rate, compared to 80% for first-class and 40% for third-class children. No seniors survived in the second and third classes, while only 17% (one individual) survived in the first class. It is essential to conduct a deeper statistical analysis for the first class result to determine if this survival rate among seniors is statistically significant or due to chance.
